# Mobius-strip

### How you structured the code

---

#### 1. `MobiusStrip` Class (Encapsulation)

All logic is modularized within a single class for reusability and clarity.

```python
class MobiusStrip:
    def __init__(self, R, w, n): ...
```

---

#### 2. Mesh Generation (`_generate_mesh`)

Implements the parametric equations to generate the 3D surface grid.

```python
def _generate_mesh(self):
    x = (R + v⋅cos(u/2))⋅cos(u)
    y = (R + v⋅cos(u/2))⋅sin(u)
    z = v⋅sin(u/2)
```

---

#### 3. Surface Area Calculation (`compute_surface_area`)

Uses numerical approximation via the cross product of partial derivatives and integrates using `scipy.integrate.simpson`.

---

#### 4. Edge Length Calculation (`compute_edge_length`)

Samples points along the boundary at `v = w/2`, computes differential arc lengths, and integrates.

---

#### 5. Visualization (`plot`)

Renders a 3D plot using `matplotlib` for visual verification of the modeled Möbius strip.

---

#### 6. Main Execution Block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)

For testing the class: instantiates an object, prints computed values, and shows the plot.

---

This clean object-oriented structure ensures modularity, readability, and easy expansion.
